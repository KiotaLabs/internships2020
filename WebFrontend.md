# Web Frontend Questions

For frontend applicants, the following questions have been created. They are presented in increasing order of difficulty - Question 1 is the simplest and Question 3 should be the hardest. Don't worry about completing all questions. Since this is an internship, we are happy to help you build your skill set with us. If you decide against answering any of the following questions, write to us describing your frontend skills in some other way.

## Question 1

1. Create a simple webpage which has an embedded YouTube player.
2. Use the handlebars templating engine. The youtube link of the video to be played should be passed in the context while rendering the page.

## Question 2

1. Use the OpenLayers library to create a simple webpage containing a map of India with Delhi and Mumbai marked on the map. The map should be zoomed in to show Delhi in the center of the page by default.
2. Clicking on the Icon for Delhi should move the map to bring Mumbai in the center. Use animation to show the map moving on the screen, instead of rendering the map again.
3. Next, clicking on the icon for Mumbai should move the map to bring Delhi in the center of the page.

If you've been redirected to this page, then you've most likely already applied for an internship with us. Thank you for showing interest. 

We have a tradition of giving out short assignments to applicants to gauge their interest and skill set. The applicants for this year need to answer questions mentioned in this repository. 

We have a mix of conceptual and programming questions, and you can be totally flexible with your answers. Answer as many as you like, submit as many times as you want. 

This collection is work in progress. We've added questions for [Java](https://github.com/KiotaLabs/internships2020/blob/master/SoftwareDevelopmentJava.md) and we'll be adding the Python assignment next. Candidates who've applied for the Javascript role would need to be a little more patient.

Send your submissions through Internshala itself, or mail us directly at aditya@kiotalabs.com
